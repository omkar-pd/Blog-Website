(1, 1, 'How to Write Clean Code', 0, 'randomImg.jpg', '&lt;p&gt;There are two things- Programming and Good Programming. Programming is what we have all been doing. Now is the time to do good programming. We all know that even the bad code works. But it takes time and resources to make a program good. Moreover, other developers mock you when they are trying to find what all is happening in your code. But it&amp;rsquo;s never too late to care for your programs.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This book has given me a lot of knowledge on what are the best practices and how to actually write code. Now I feel ashamed of my coding skills. Though I always strive to better my code, this book has taught a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Now, you are reading this blog for two reasons. First, you are a programmer. Second, you want to be a better programmer. Good. We need better programmers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;haracteristics of a Clean code&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;It should be elegant &amp;mdash; Clean code should be&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;pleasing&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;to read. Reading it should make you smile the way a well-crafted music box or well-designed car would.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Clean code is focused &amp;mdash;Each function, each class, each module exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely undistracted, and unpolluted, by the surrounding details.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Clean code is taken care of. Someone has taken the time to keep it simple and orderly. They have paid appropriate attention to details. They have cared.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;Runs all the tests&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;5. Contains no duplication&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;6. Minimize the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;How to write Clean code?&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meaningful Names&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Use intention revealing names. Choosing good names takes time but saves more than it takes.The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Eg- int d; // elapsed time in days.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We should choose a name that specifies what is being measured and the unit of that measurement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;A better name would be:- int elapsedTime. (Even though the book says elapsedTimeInDays, I would still prefer the former one. Suppose the elapsed time is changed to milliseconds. Then we would have to change long to int and elapsedTimeInMillis instead of elapsedTimeInDays. And for how long we&amp;rsquo;ll keep changing both the data type and name.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class Names&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names like Customer, WikiPage, Account, and AddressParser. Avoid words like Manager, Processor, Data, or Info in the name of a class. A class name should not be a verb.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method Names &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt;Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like postPayment, deletePage, or save. Accessors, mutators, and predicates should be named for their value and prefixed with get, set.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;When constructors are overloaded, use static factory methods with names that describe the arguments. For example,&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Complex fulcrumPoint = Complex.FromRealNumber(23.0); is generally better than Complex fulcrumPoint = new Complex(23.0);&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick One Word per Concept &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt;Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it. For instance, it&amp;rsquo;s confusing to have fetch, retrieve, and get as equivalent methods of different classes. How do you remember which method name goes with which class? Likewise, it&amp;rsquo;s confusing to have a controller and a manager and a driver in the same code base. What is the essential difference between a DeviceManager and a Protocol- Controller?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n', '2021-08-11 08:53:23', '2021-08-11 08:53:23'),

That defeat for Australia came at the hands of the champion West Indies side, this has come from a New Incredible India.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The similarities with the 2000-01 series ends with the fact that then India came back from the dead thanks to the resolve of the champions of that generation, VVS Laxman, Rahul Dravid and Harbhajan Singh. Something similar happened this time, only this time, these young men were not even the first choice picks in the XI.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Anil Kumble and Javagal Srinath had been injured then, a country had lost faith in cricket because of the match-fixing scandal. The resources were at their weakest for India then.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This time around the magnitude of the triumph is much bigger because of the surreal times that we live in. COVID-19, hard quarantine, soft quarantine, being locked up in hotel rooms, no crowds at times. Then to add to it, the capitulation for 36 in the first Test at Adelaide you would have been pardoned if you thought this team would roll over and die.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The steely resolve of the team comes from the top, captain Ajinkya Rahane, who now remains an unbeaten Test captain. He will no doubt move back into the ranks in the next Test series, but this feat is simply incredible to have been achieved, when lesser men would have caved in without a fight. Rahane set the tone for the revival with a splendid hundred and the aggressive approach on the final day in Gabba.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;India has come close in the past to winning Test series in Australia. In 1977-78, a side ravaged by Kerry Packer circus awaited India, but they still lost 2-3. Then in 1985-86, an Australian side facing desertions in the form of rebel tours held a much-fancied Indian side 0-0 thanks to weather and poor umpiring. In 2003-04, came India&amp;rsquo;s best-ever chance to force a win on the final day at the Sydney, the swansong of Steve Waugh, but it was not to be the series ended 1-1.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Those Indian sides had champions who are still revered as the greatest to have played the game for the country. But what this Indian side had in plenty was resolve and the courage to fight.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Look no further than Cheteshwar Pujara who was battered and bruised by all the blows he received. He had hardly played a game before the tour started. For him to stand steadfast in the face of the greatest Test attack currently in operation was simply superb.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;But the tour has belonged to the unheralded, Shubman Gill, T Natarajan, Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur and of course Rishabh Pant. Virat Kohli spoke of New India at the start of the tour. This ladies and gentlemen - New India.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This band of young men, some of whom were not meant to play any Test, showed plenty of resolve and character to script the unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;In particular the arrival of Gill and Pant shows that the next generation of Indian batsmen are here. Gill has already been earmarked as future superstar. Pant on the other hand, divides opinions and frustrates you at times. But the way Pant batted in the final innings of the series showed that he needs to be left alone and he too needs to leave social media alone. With this knock Pant has effectively ended the debate of whether he the better batsman should play or Wriddhiman Saha the better &amp;lsquo;keeper should play. Ofcourse there may come a time in the future that Pant could play as a pure batsman even in Test cricket.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Natarajan, Siraj, Thakur make up quite possibly the unlikeliest of Test attacks possible in the history of the format. But together they do deserve praise for stalling the Australian line-up including the likes of David Warner, Marnus Labuschange and Steven Smith.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Last time around when India won the Test series in Australia in 2018-19, you did hear taunts about the absence of Warner and Smith. Possibly for the first time an undermanned India got the better of a first-choice Australia in Australia, because usually it is the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This Test series win will have as much impact on India like that famous 2000-1 win did. Last time it rekindled the faith in the sport, this time it will reignite the passion for Test match cricket.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Last time India won in Australia, Kohli and head coach Ravi Shastri called it bigger than a World Cup triumph. Well, this time it is bigger than the last series win, because of the world we are now inhabiting.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;A Test series win away from home is always much more special if you have lived through the dry spell in 1980s and the horrible 1990s for Indian cricket.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;And before we forget credit is also due to the coaching staff led by Shastri. We were quick to call for his head post the Adelaide debacle. But if he deserves ridicule for that, he and his staff certainly deserve credit for the series triumph.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;On a final note, since miracles do happen, without sounding greedy, can we also request for a bowler who can knock the tail over quickly?&amp;nbsp; Will find out soon if that wish is granted too.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n', '2021-08-25 05:40:00', '2021-08-25 05:40:00'),
(16, 8, 'The Rise of Virat Kohli', 0, 'vk.jpg', '&lt;p&gt;Kohli was averaging 106 in the last 5 chases in T20&amp;rsquo;s before this match. And today, after an injured Yuvraj laboured to 21 and was dismissed by Faulkner in the 14th&amp;nbsp;over in this Ind vs Aus World T20 encounter, it was over to captain (Dhoni) and vice-captain. With 39 required off 18 deliveries, it seemed like a hairy end approaching. The next 13 balls read 4 4 6 2 1 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 0 4 4 4 0 4&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4. Dhoni played only 2 of these and scored 6 including the winning boundary. Kohli sunk to the ground as the ball crossed the boundary &amp;ndash; a departure from the usual punch in the air and raised bat celebration &amp;ndash; testifying how this chase had tested his temperament, still he managed to come out on top.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Early Life&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The youngest among three siblings, Kohli was born in Delhi and had a passion for cricket from an age of just three. He would often play gully cricket and it was then that the neighbours suggested that Kohli should get professional training. It was around this time, in the year 1998 that West Delhi Cricket Academy was formed and Kohli was among one of the first students there. Kohli was not only good in cricket, he was an excellent student and is admired by his teachers.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Start of the Cricket life&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Kohli started his formal cricketing career with the Delhi under 15 teams in October 2002 for the Polly Umrigar Trophy. He scored 72 runs with an average of 34.40 and was the highest run getter for his team. Next year, he became the captain of the team for the same trophy and scored a whopping 390 runs in 5 innings. The Delhi under 15 teams saw a number of wins under his leadership.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Kohli was chosen in the India under 19 team in the year 2006 for the tour of England. He performed well with the Indians went on to win the series.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;In the same year, Kohli made his debut in first-class cricket for Delhi and scored 10 in his debut innings. It was during this time that his father died of brain stroke. Kohli&amp;rsquo;s commitment towards cricket and his professionalism superseded his personal tragedy. He decided to play for his team against Karnataka a day after his father&amp;rsquo;s demise. Kohli then went on to play the T-20 format for the Delhi team which earned him recognition and soon a place in the Royal Challengers Bangalore team for $30,000 on a youth contract.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;The Indian Cricket Team Journey&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Kohli was taken in the Indian Cricket ODI team for the tour of Srilanka and the Champions Trophy to Pakistan. He scored his first fifty in the fourth match, at an age of 19. Kohli was taken as a replacement for an injured Shikhar Dhawan for the unofficial test tour to Australia where he batted once and scored 49. In 2008, during India&amp;rsquo;s England tour, although Kohli was a part of the team, he did not get a chance to play in the team due to the presence of Tendulkar and Sehwag. He was also selected in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament in Australia in 2009 where his performance impressed the world.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Kohli started to be taken in most of the series that India played around this time but was taken more as a replacement of injured players rather than being taken as a permanent and indispensable player. The feat with IPL, however, continued where Kohli continued to play exceptionally well and earn accolades.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;In 2010, since Tendulkar was rested from the team, Kohli found a chance to play in all the 5 matches of the tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh. In the match against Bangladesh, when India while chasing 297 was struggling at 51/3, Kohli scored 91 to help India win the match. Kohli played exceptionally well becoming the highest runner in the series and became the third batsman in the world to score two ODI centuries before their 22nd&amp;nbsp;birthday, the first two being Sachin Tendulkar and Suresh Raina. He was praised for his outstanding performance, especially by the Indian captain M.S. Dhoni.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Kohli was named as the vice-captain in the tri-series against Srilanka and Zimbabwe 2010 itself and there was no looking back. He became the fastest Indian batsman to reach 1000 runs in ODI cricket. Although he struggled with his form sometimes, but his perseverance earned him a permanent spot in the Indian team. He played in the International World Cup and was one of the main players who steered India to victory after 28 years.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Kohli however, earned the tag of an ODI player due to his high run rates and was not thought to be a Test player by the experts of cricket. He&amp;nbsp;proved everybody wrong when he made 132 in the test tour of Australia, 2011. With his consistent performances and aggressive style, he was chosen unanimously as the captain for&amp;nbsp;tests when Dhoni retired from the 5 day format in the 2014/15 series against Australia.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;The records&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Kohli started a series of records with being the third batsman in the world scoring 1000 ODI runs before turning 22. In 2013, Kohli became the captain of the Indian cricket team for the triangular series in West Indies after Dhoni was injured and found unfit to play. In the second match of the tournament, Kohli scored his first hundred as a captain scoring 102 off 83 balls. In the seven-match ODI series against Australia, Kohli hit the third fastest ODI century, crossing the 100 run mark in 61 balls. In the two-match Test series against West Indies, which is memorable as the last Test series of Tendulkar, Kohli equaled Viv Richard&amp;rsquo;s record of being the fastest batsman to get 5000 runs in ODI.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Virat Kohli has attributed his success to his coach Rajkumar Sharma and the guidance he received from former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi. Such an unbelievable feat of success has not been able to sweep Kohli off the grounds. He remains a very humble person, a true role model for youths of India. Recently, he has been rated 8th&amp;nbsp;in ESPN&amp;rsquo;s top 10 most popular sportsmen in the world being preceded by sportsmen like Christiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Roger Federer etc. And this is where he belongs.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n', '2021-09-08 09:20:20', '2021-09-13 05:54:56'),

I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very good at studies, as soon as the school bell rang, I would be out on the field until dinner time!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;My tryst with full-time cricket began in a funny way &amp;mdash; I won the gold medal in only one sport when I was around 10 years old and that was in skating! My father sat me down that day and said, &amp;lsquo;I understand you can&amp;rsquo;t study but if you love sports so much at least take one that can get you somewhere&amp;hellip;focus on cricket.&amp;rsquo; That&amp;rsquo;s how it all started.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Even while growing up there were struggles &amp;mdash; I didn&amp;rsquo;t get selected at the under 14 trials in Haryana, but at every step of the way I pushed harder towards the one goal that I wanted to dedicate my life towards&amp;hellip;playing for India.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;I still remember, my first real &amp;lsquo;job&amp;rsquo; was playing for Air India&amp;rsquo;s corporate team and my stipend for the whole month was 500 Rupees given by Punjab Communications.&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\\r\\nThe real turning point was the Under 19 World Cup where I performed better than ever before. I remember at that point, I would watch Tendulkar and Ganguly on my television set and know on every fiber of my being that someday I would be out there playing with them&amp;mdash; I felt it, I knew it; I believed it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;In 2000 I got the opportunity to play my first International game with these big guns. I can&amp;rsquo;t describe that experience &amp;mdash; in my head, I was still the little boy from Chandigarh running around on the field, muddy, breaking windows with my shots but when I looked around I saw my heroes &amp;mdash; Tendulkar, Ganguly, Kumble on the field with me.&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\\r\\nAs I eased into playing with them, they turned into my family. Having always been a prankster, the Indian dressing room was no different for me.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;On one April Fool&amp;rsquo;s day, Bhajji and I decided to prank Ganguly. We went down to the business center and reprinted the front page of the Times of India, with bogus stories of Ganguly saying nasty things about the entire Indian Team. Before the match, we gave him the newspaper and said we were very disappointed. He saw the newspaper and lost his cool. He began to say, &amp;lsquo;if I&amp;rsquo;ve ever said any of this I&amp;rsquo;ll resign as the captain&amp;rsquo;. We let this go on until Dravid decided to tell him it was April&amp;rsquo;s fools day which made him even angrier &amp;mdash; he chased the two of us around the field with a bat in his hand!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Jokes apart, the journey has been tremendous. Whether it was hitting 6 sixes, or winning the 2011 World Cup, these are special moments which very few people in the world have the privilege of experiencing and that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt while playing for my country &amp;mdash; privileged.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, there have been downs as well &amp;mdash; one cannot always live up to the expectations where a nation of 1.2 billion people wants you to win every single game.&lt;br /&gt;\r\n\\r\\nMore than that, nothing could have been worse than having to give up something you love &amp;mdash;and I had to get out of the game for many months because of my battle with cancer. At first, I was in denial about it &amp;mdash; playing for India was more important than my health and for a few months I chose to ignore the blood I spat out or my decline in stamina.It&amp;rsquo;s only once I accepted cancer that I could beat it. When life knocks down you have a choice &amp;mdash; to get up. So I thought to myself -get up and do it again&amp;rsquo;. I came back within 3 months of my treatment, only because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t done with cricket &amp;mdash; I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll ever be done with it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The way I look at it, I went through cancer so that through my foundation YouWeCan I could do more for those who need it. I believe that I had to go through it to have a larger purpose. God has been kind enough to give me everything and the only way forward is to give back. I&amp;rsquo;m constantly looking for ways to push this cause and through YWCFashion, I&amp;rsquo;m looking to enter a different avenue and make the fight against cancer even stronger. Today, I sponsor the entire education of 25 kids who&amp;rsquo;s parents don&amp;rsquo;t have the funds. When I met them and they told me about their ambitions, I knew that this is what I want to continue doing&amp;mdash; give back and help them make a &amp;lsquo;come back&amp;rsquo;, just like I did.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n', '2021-09-06 07:05:50', '2021-09-06 07:05:50'),
(19, 4, 'Sass Style Guide: A Sass Tutorial on How to Write Better CSS Code', 0, 'sass.png', '&lt;p&gt;When working on big web applications as a team with other developers, code needs to be scalable and readable. This can be a challenging process when it comes to CSS, although preprocessors like Sass are available. But only using preprocessors will only get you so far. In this article, Toptal engineer Matias Hernandez presents a style guide with advice on how to improve the way you write your code.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Writing consistent and readable CSS that will scale well is a challenging process. Especially when the style sheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. One of the tools available to developers to write better CSS are preprocessors. A preprocessor is a program that takes one type of data and converts it to another type of data, and in our case CSS preprocessors are preprocessing languages which are compiled to CSS. There are many CSS preprocessors that&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.toptal.com/front-end&quot;&gt;front-end developers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are recommending and using, but in this article we will focus on Sass. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.toptal.com/front-end/embracing-sass-why-you-should-stop-using-vanilla-css&quot;&gt;Sass has to offer&lt;/a&gt;, why it is a preferable choice over other CSS preprocessors, and how to start using it in the best way.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;What Is Sass and Why Should You Use It?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know what is Sass, the best starting point is to visit the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com/&quot;&gt;official Sass webpage&lt;/a&gt;. Sass is an acronym for Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets, and is an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;With Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) your CSS code will be also awesome.&quot; src=&quot;https://uploads.toptal.io/blog/image/91625/toptal-blog-image-1441289939715-f71ac4c4849110d4a414f2d4d939c2dd.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;With Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) your CSS code will be also awesome.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Sass is a CSS preprocessor with a lot of powerful features. The most notable features are&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#variables_&quot;&gt;variables&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#extend&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#mixins&quot;&gt;mixins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Variables store information that can be reused later, like colors or other commonly used values. Extends help you create &amp;ldquo;classes&amp;rdquo; that allow inheritance for the rules. Mixins, you can think of like &amp;ldquo;function&amp;rdquo;. Sass also has some other amazing features in comparison with other preprocessors, like the use of logic statements (conditionals and loops), custom functions, integration with other libraries like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://compass-style.org/&quot;&gt;Compas&lt;/a&gt;, and many more. These features alone can help you and your team to be more productive and to write better CSS in the end.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Why You Need a CSS Style Guide&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even preprocessors can&amp;rsquo;t fix everything and help you write good CSS code. The problem every developer is facing is that current web applications are becoming bigger and bigger. That&amp;rsquo;s why code needs to be scalable and readable, and needs to avoid&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code&quot;&gt;spaghetti code&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and unused lines of it. To avoid mentioned problems, some sort of standard for your team in the daily work is needed. What is spaghetti code, and how does it it happen? Spaghetti code is a name for bad, slow, repetitive, and unreadable code. When a team writes big applications without defined guidelines or standards in place, each developer writes what he needs and how he wants. Also when developers are writing a lot of bug fixes, hotfixes, and patches, they tend to write code that will solve the problem but don&amp;rsquo;t have time to write the code in the best way. In these situations, it is very usual to end up with lots of lines of CSS that are not used in any sector of the application any more. Developers don&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to clean the code, and they are forced to publish the fix as quickly as possible. Another reocurring situation is that to fix broken things quickly, developers use a lot of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt;, which results with very hacky code that is hard to maintain, it results with a lot unexpected behaviors, and needs to be refactored later. As mentioned already, as the code grows the situation becomes only worse.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The idea of this article is to share rules, tips, and best practices to write a better Sass. Grouping together those Sass tips and best practices can be used as a Sass style guide. This style guide should help developers to avoid situations mentioned above. Rules are grouped into logical segments for easier referencing, but in the end you should adopt and follow them all. Or at least, most of them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Style Guide&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The set of rules and best practices in this style guide are adopted based on experience working with a lot of teams. Some of them come from trial by error, and others are inspired by some popular approaches like BEM. For some rules there is no specific reason why and how they were set. Sometimes having the past experience as the only reason is enough. For example, to make sure that the code is readable it is important that all developers are writing the code in the same way, thus there is the rule to not include spaces between parentheses. We can argue if it is better to include the space between parenthesis or not. If you think that it looks better when there are spaces between parenthesis, adjust this style guide and rules by your preferences. In the end, the main goal of the style guide is to define rules, and to make the developing process more standard.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Main goal of the style guide is to define rules, and to make the developing process more standard.&quot; src=&quot;https://uploads.toptal.io/blog/image/91627/toptal-blog-image-1441290676782-ec624ac038f4d3758fd5c5cf8db3a905.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Main goal of the style guide is to define rules, and to make the developing process more standard.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;General CSS Rules&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;General rules should always be followed. They are mostly focused on how Sass code should be formatted to bring consistency and readability of the code:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;For indentation, use spaces instead of tabs. The best practice is to use 2 spaces. You can run your own sacred war with this option, and you can define your own rule and use either tabs, or spaces, or whatever suits you best. It is only important to define a rule and follow that rule while being consistent.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Include an empty line between each statement. This makes the code more human readable, and code is written by humans, right?&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Use one selector per line, like this:&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;code&gt;selector1,\r\nselector2 {\r\n}\r\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Do not include a space between parentheses.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;code&gt;selector {\r\n   @include mixin1($size: 4, $color: red);\r\n}\r\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Use single quotes to enclose strings and URLs:&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;code&gt;selector { font-family: &amp;lsquo;Roboto&amp;rsquo;, serif; }\r\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;End all rules with a semicolon without spaces before:&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;code&gt;selector {\r\n  margin: 10px;\r\n}\r\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Rules for Selectors&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Next we are following with a set of rules to use when dealing with selectors:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Avoid the use of ID selectors. IDs are too specific and used mostly for JavaScript actions.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Avoid&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt;. If you need to use this rule, it means that something is wrong with your CSS rules in general, and that your CSS is not structured well. CSS with many&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;rules can be easily abused and ends up with messy and hard to maintain CSS code.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Do not use child selector. This rule shares the same reasoning as the ID one. Child selectors are too specific and are tightly coupled with your HTML structure.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;If you are using !important a lot in your CSS, you are doing it wrong.&quot; src=&quot;https://uploads.toptal.io/blog/image/91626/toptal-blog-image-1441289968114-a2d21ef63fc5319ca34593b0b0fdd38b.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;If you are using !important a lot in your CSS, you are doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Keep Your Sass Rules in Order&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;It is important to keep consistency in the code. One of the rules is that you need to keep the order of rules. This way other developers can read the code with much more understanding, and will spend less time finding their way around. Here is the proposed order:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Use&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;@extend&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;first. This let you know at first that this class inherits rules from elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Use&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;@include&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;next. Having your mixins and functions included at top is nice to have, and also allows you to know what you will be overwriting (if needed).&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Now you can write your regular CSS class or element rules.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Place nested pseudo classes and pseudo elements before any other element.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Finally, write other nested selectors like in the following example:&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;code&gt;.homepage {\r\n  @extend page;\r\n  @include border-radius(5px);\r\n  margin-left: 5px;\r\n  &amp;amp;:after{\r\n    content: &amp;lsquo;&amp;rsquo;;\r\n  }\r\n  a {\r\n  }\r\n  ul {\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Some naming conventions&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Naming conventions part of the style book is based on the two existing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/&quot;&gt;BEM&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://smacss.com/&quot;&gt;SMACSS&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;naming conventions that became popular amongst developers. BEM stands for Block, Element, Modifier. It was developed by the YANDEX team, and the idea behind BEM was to help developers understand the relationship between HTML and CSS in the project. SMACSS on the other hand stands for Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS. It is a guide to structure CSS to allow maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Inspired by them, our naming conventions rules are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Use prefix for each type of element. Prefix your blocks, like: layouts (&lt;code&gt;l-&lt;/code&gt;), modules (&lt;code&gt;m-&lt;/code&gt;), and states (&lt;code&gt;is-&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Use two underscores for child elements for every block:&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;code&gt;.m-tab__icon {}\r\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Use two dashes for modifiers for every block:&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;code&gt;.m-tab--borderless {}\r\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Variables&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Use variables. Start with the more general and global variables like colors, and create a separate file for them&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;_colors.scss&lt;/code&gt;. If you notice you are repeating some value over the style sheet multiple times, go and create a new variable for that value. Please&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself&quot;&gt;DRY&lt;/a&gt;. You will be grateful when you want to change that value, and when you will need to change it in only one place.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Also, use a hyphen to name your variables:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;code&gt;$red : #f44336;\r\n$secondary-red :#ebccd1;\r\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Media Queries&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;With Sass you can write your media queries as element queries. Most of the developers write media queries in a separate file or at the bottom of our rules, but that is not recommended. With Sass you can write things like the following example by nesting media queries:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;code&gt;// SCSS\r\n.m-block {\r\n  &amp;amp;:after {\r\n    @include breakpoint(tablet){\r\n      content: &amp;#39;&amp;#39;;\r\n      width: 100%;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This generates a CSS like this:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;code&gt;// Generated CSS\r\n@media screen and (min-width: 767px) {\r\n  .m-block:after {\r\n    content: &amp;#39;&amp;#39;;\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This nested media queries rules allow you to know very clearly what rules are you overwriting, as you can see in the Sass snippet where named media queries are used.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;To create named media queries, create your mixin like this:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;code&gt;@mixin breakpoint($point) {\r\n  @if $point == tablet {\r\n    @media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) {\r\n      @content;\r\n    }\r\n  } @else if $point == phone {\r\n    @media (max-width: 767px) {\r\n      @content;\r\n    }\r\n  } @else if $point == desktop {\r\n    @media (min-width: 1025px) {\r\n      @content;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;You can read more about naming media queries in the following articles:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/naming-media-queries/&quot;&gt;Naming Media Queries&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://davidwalsh.name/write-media-queries-sass&quot;&gt;Write Better Media Queries with Sass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Other Considerations&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, here are some other considerations that you should also keep in mind and follow:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Never write vendor prefixes. Use&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer&quot;&gt;autoprefixer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;instead.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Use maximum three levels of deep in nested rules. With more than three nested levels, the code will be difficult to read, and maybe you are writing a crappy selector. In the end, you are writing CSS code to couple with your HTML.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;code&gt;.class1 {\r\n   .class2 {\r\n       li {\r\n           //last rules\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t write more than 50 lines of nested code: Or better, don&amp;rsquo;t write more than X lines of nested code. Setup your own X, but 50 looks like a good limit. If you pass that limit maybe the block of code will not fit in your text editor window.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Write a main file where you will import all of your blocks, partials, and configs.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Import vendor and global dependencies first, then authored dependencies, then layouts, patterns, and finally the parts and blocks. This is important to avoid mixed imports and overwrite of rules, because the vendor and global rules can&amp;rsquo;t be managed by us.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be shy and break your code in as many files as possible.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this style guide is to give you some advice on how to improve the way you are writing your Sass code. Please keep in mind that even if you are not using Sass, the provided tips and rules in this style guide are also applicable and recommended to follow if you use Vanilla CSS or another preprocessor. Again, if you don&amp;rsquo;t agree with any of the rules, change the rule to fit your way of thinking. In the end, it is up to you and your team to either adapt this style guide, use some other style guide, or create a completely new one. Just define the guide, and start writing an awesome code.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n', '2021-09-13 06:11:07', '2021-09-13 06:14:06');

What is the difference between JavaScript and AngularJS?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n	&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n		&lt;tr&gt;\r\n			&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n			&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AngularJS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n		&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n		&lt;tr&gt;\r\n			&lt;td&gt;It is a programing language.&lt;/td&gt;\r\n			&lt;td&gt;It is a framework primarily used for web as well as mobile-based applications.&lt;/td&gt;\r\n		&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n		&lt;tr&gt;\r\n			&lt;td&gt;It supports programming paradigms such as conditional statements, iterations, exceptions, etc.&lt;/td&gt;\r\n			&lt;td&gt;It supports iterations or any other conditional constructs.&lt;/td&gt;\r\n		&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n		&lt;tr&gt;\r\n			&lt;td&gt;Filters are not supported in JS.&lt;/td&gt;\r\n			&lt;td&gt;Filters are supported in AngularJS.&lt;/td&gt;\r\n		&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n		&lt;tr&gt;\r\n			&lt;td&gt;It is used in building frameworks.&lt;/td&gt;\r\n			&lt;td&gt;It is built by using JS.&lt;/td&gt;\r\n		&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n	&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;2. What is the drawback of using a type of bar ===&amp;rdquo; object&amp;rdquo; in order to determine if the bar is an object? What measures would you take to avoid this?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nThe above statement can be used to check if a bar is an object, but this poses the problem that even null will also be considered as the object. So the code will log to true instead of false. So, a better way to do this is to apply a check for the null keyword also.&lt;br /&gt;\r\ne.g- print ((bar! =null) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (&amp;ldquo;typeof bar===&amp;rdquo; object&amp;rdquo;)); //prints false&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;3. Why do we wrap the content of the JS file into a single function block?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nThis is done in order to create a closure around file contents, which creates a private namespace and therefore helps in resolving name clashes between modules and libraries.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Popular Course in this category&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Related Courses&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;4. Why do we use &amp;ldquo;use strict&amp;rdquo; at the beginning of the JS file?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nThis is the most common Javascript Interview Questions which is frequently asked in a Javascript interview.&amp;ldquo;use-strict&amp;rdquo; is a method to enforce strict parsing and error handling at runtime. There could be some code errors that could be ignored, but now they will be thrown explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;5. What is NaN? How do you intend to test the value if it is equal to NaN?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nNaN represents a value that is not a number. This could be the case when either of the numerator or the denominator value is non-numeric (e.g.- abc/6) or maybe because the result of the operation is non-numeric. You can use isNaN(), but that is not considered as the most reliable way. Another way would be to use abc! =abc and num.isNaN(), which are considered as a more efficient way to test.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Part 2 &amp;ndash; Javascript Interview Questions&amp;nbsp;(Advanced)&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Let us now have a look at the advanced Javascript Interview Questions&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;6. What is closure in JavaScript?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nA closure is referred to as an inner function having access to the variables in the outer function&amp;rsquo;s scope chain. The closure has access to three scoped variables:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Variables in their own scope&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Variables in the function&amp;rsquo;s scope&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Global variables&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;7. What is function hoisting? What are the two ways of creating a function?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nIn JavaScript, functions and variables are hoisted. The JS interpreter looks forward to finding all the relevant declarations and then hoist them above the function, right where they are declared. There are two ways of creating functions in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Function Declaration&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Function Expression&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;1.Function Declaration: it defines the function with the specified parameters.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Syntax: function name(paramater1, parameter2,&amp;hellip;)&lt;br /&gt;\r\n{&lt;br /&gt;\r\nStatement block&lt;br /&gt;\r\n.&lt;br /&gt;\r\n.&lt;br /&gt;\r\n.&lt;br /&gt;\r\n}&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Function declarations hoist the definitions, and therefore you can use these functions even before they are declared. This behavior holds valid if your functions are declared inside the global or the functional scope, which is also known as Local Scope in JS. Never use function declarations inside conditional blocks.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;2.Function Expression: The keyword &amp;ldquo;function&amp;rdquo; is used to define a function within a function.&lt;br /&gt;\r\nSyntax: const myFunc= function [name] (parameter1, parameter2, &amp;hellip;.){&lt;br /&gt;\r\n[ statements] }&lt;br /&gt;\r\nWhere [name] is an optional parameter.&lt;br /&gt;\r\nAs a result of which these are anonymous functions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Let us move to the next&amp;nbsp;Javascript interview questions&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;8. What are the disadvantages of using inner HTML in JavaScript?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nThe use of inner HTML in JavaScript has the following disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;When we talk about using inner HTML, it is much slower when compared to the rest of the variables. Its content is slowly built and divided into different elects which takes time to get re-parsed.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;The content gets replaced in JavaScript when we start using inner HTML.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Appends to inner HTML can&amp;rsquo;t be used properly.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Using inner HTML can be used to break the document of JS. As no validation is required, using any type of inner HTML can be a good approach. Broken HTML can pose serious problems.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;The age-old content can be easily replaced.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;9. What are screen objects? Define its properties?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nThis is the advanced Javascript Interview Questions asked in an interview. Screen objects are used to read different types of information from a client screen. Properties are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;A height of the screen is provided.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;Images on the client screen are also provided.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;A width of the screen is provided.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;The height of the client screen includes the taskbar and screen objects give the total height.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;The width of the screen includes the taskbar and the overall width is available to users&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;10. How does a cookie is read in JS?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nJS is used to read a cookie.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.educba.com/cookies-in-javascript/&quot;&gt;A cookie is&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;just a value of another object which is also termed as the document cookie. This string can be used to get cookies. The same string keeps a tab of the name lists and writing the cookies in different ways such as by using a semicolon. Generally, a cookie is just a single value.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;In this&amp;nbsp;Javascript Interview Questions post, we read about some of the most popular and important JavaScript interview questions and answers.
